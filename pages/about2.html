Them, and the creators of Escape Velocity; that was a sick game. We also played Power Pete as kids, if you remember that. My dad invested heavily in technology, but in the form of a Performa PowerPC. And anyway by the time we had the dome-and-screen-on-a-stick Mac running OSX, I'd already discovered Linux. And anyway yeah Altavista was the best for finding mp3s.</div>

                I am hanging out in an expat bar in Subic Bay, shooting pool with Bobcat, when we are approached by two girls. They ask if they can join us. It comes up that they're just looking for fun, not for boyfriends. <br>
                "That's fine," I say, "we're gay." <br>
                "Oh good, we're lesbians." <br>
                It turns out we are both lying, but I spend the night watching Bobcat get increasingly frustrated with his disinterested date, while mine snuggles closer to me. <br>

                A middle-aged Korean woman works as a mama-san, and takes a shine to me on Suit Night with the boys. She invites me to her sister's bar up at the top of Pale San Vitores, where Dong Man Lee teaches me how to shoot pool properly (get down to the table level, it's so obvious). <br>
                She feeds me with chopsticks, weird dried fish and other snacks. She brings a plastic bag full of K-soaps on VHS to my apartment, where she finds I do not have a television. <br>
