              The hubbub began to subside slowly as Major ---- de Coverley paused in the doorway with a frown of puzzled disapproval, as though viewing something bizarre. He started forward in a straight line, and the wall of officers before him parted like the Red Sea. Glancing neither left nor right, he strode indomitably up to the steam counter and, in a clear, full-bodied voice that was gruff with age and resonant with ancient eminence and authority, said: <br>
              "Gimme eat." <br>
              Instead of eat, Corporal Snark gave Major ---- de Coverley a loyalty oath to sign. Major ---- de Coverley swept it away with mighty displeasure the moment he recognized what it was, his good eye flaring up blindingly with firey disdain and his enormous old corrugated face darkening in mountainous wrath. <br>
              "Gimme eat, I said," he ordered loudly in harsh tones that rumbled ominously through the silent tent like claps of distant thunder. <br>
              Corporal Snark turned pale and began to tremble. He glanced toward Milo pleadingly for guidance. For several terrible seconds there was not a sound. Then Milo nodded. <br>
              "Give him eat," he said.
