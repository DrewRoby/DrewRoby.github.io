            Be warned-- herein is the personal page. I guess it's been an interesting road, now that I reflect on it. Maybe you agree.

                <strong>Early Life</strong><br>
                Graduated from Westminster Christian Academy in St. Louis, MO. Not yet knowing what career path to pursue, inquired with both the Coast Guard and the Navy.
                I often think about the decision I made then, the signs I saw, and the ones I missed.

                <strong>Nuke School</strong><br>
                Joined the United States Navy as a nuclear operator. Completed intensive training at Naval Nuclear Power Training Command (NNPTC)
                in Goose Creek, SC, learning the theory and practice of industrial mechanical components for Machinist's Mate qualifications,
                before proceeding to learn the theory of nuclear power as practiced in the US Navy.

                I return to Missouri and enroll at Truman State University, initially studying Computer Science.
                I join the agricultural fraternity, Alpha Gamma Rho, and switch to Agricultural Science the following semester.

                <strong>Finding Direction</strong><br>
                Unhappy with my career trajectory, I leave university to reassess my path. I work delivering pizzas by night, and as a barista by day. Here I meet my future wife, sister of the coffee-shop owner.
                During this time, I develop a strong interest in economics during a libertarian phase. I come across Milton Friedman and get off the train at the Chicago school.
                (I admire many Austrians, but could never get into Von Mises and Rothbard).
                Become a big fan of Alex Tabbarok and Tyler Cowen's <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com">Marginal Revolution</a> blog.
                Decide if I go back to school, it'll be to study Econ.

                <strong>Hard Reset: Unyson Logistics</strong><br>
                Move to St. Louis to land first real data job, acquired (I'm convinced) with the phrase, "I like to tell stories with data."
                In school I'd been strongly influenced by a professor, Rossen Trendafilov, who introduced me to the tools used for large datasets, specifically R.
                Until then, the problems around analyzing years-worth of second-to-second data had never occurred to me.
                Once they had, I would constantly think about how to model data so that it could be presented in a coherent way. <br>
                Had several foundational experiences at Unyson. They were in the middle of a huge system-level software cutover, while implementing new business on top of it.
                A tricky, fast-paced game to play, and not for the faint of heart. <br>
                If half the story is the people behind the data, then I found that half the story is sometimes cranky, fallible, confused, or unhelpful. It's important to bring some grace to work. <br>
                In fact, the job of BI Analyst is largely the art of giving people what they want, not what they ask for. That may have been the most important lesson of all.

                <strong>Lane Change: Enterprise Holdings, Inc.</strong><br>
                The decree had gone out from Boston when I was at Unyson, that forsooth, "Data Science Is The Future."
                From speaking with personal contacts, it occurred to me that if those data scientists were going to have anything to do,
                then some data engineers would need to lay some groundwork for them. So I moved to be closer to data engineering, becoming
                a software analyst for a streaming data team. <br>
                At Enterprise, I worked with some of the most talented engineers I've had the pleasure to know. They taught me most of what I know
                about Scala and operating with real-time data in a streaming environment. This was also my introduction to Java-like environments, and how setting yourself up to work in one
                can be quite the chore (hence one reason to containerize). <br>
                Great team, 10/10.

                This was a weird time for everyone, no? <br>
                I worked for Spectrum, helping them untangle some old Talend processes, then re-implementing them in an internally-built framework.
                Despite it only being a temporary position, of all the qualitative things that changed, I finally had accumulated enough XP to cash in a change in job title from "Analyst" to "Engineer."
                After years of modeling data in my head and planning out applications... I continued to model and plan.

        <h2>Personal Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            The world is a creation of a loving, holy, just, infinite, and infallible God.
            Humankind, having sinned once for all in Adam, requires redemption.
            This was accomplished, once for all, in the death and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth, the Christ, Son of God and one with the Father.
            The chief end of man is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever.
        </p>
        <p>
            Econ is a pretty useful tool for understanding the above. Psychology is another.
            Education in the physical sciences, and a life lived in practical application thereof, is of some value as well.
            However, its value is tempered by a set of affinities a given person may have, which may be natural or societal in origin.
            Which is to say, it's useful to know why the planets move around the sun, why the sky is blue, and what happens when water boils.
            This is another thing entirely than knowing innately how to apply these facts, or what lessons may be drawn from experiments with them (deductive and inductive reasoning, respectively)
