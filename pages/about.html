            Be warned-- herein is the personal page. I guess it's been an interesting road, now that I reflect on it. Maybe you agree.

                <strong>Educational Beginnings</strong><br>
                Graduated from Westminster Christian Academy in St. Louis, MO. Not yet knowing what career path to pursue, I inquired with both the Coast Guard and the Navy.
                I often think about the decision I made then, and the signs I missed.

                <strong>Navy Nuclear Operator</strong><br>
                Joined the United States Navy as a nuclear operator. Completed intensive training at Naval Nuclear Power Training Command (NNPTC)
                in Goose Creek, SC, learning the soup-to-nuts construction, operation, and maintenance of mechanical items for Machinist's Mate qualifications,
                before proceeding to nuclear power plant operations. After prototype training in Ballston Spa, NY,
                I was assigned to the USS Houston (SSN-713), homeported in Guam, where I served for 4 years.

                <strong>Academic Exploration</strong><br>
                Returned to Missouri and enrolled at Truman State University, initially studying Computer Science.
                Joined Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity and switched to Agricultural Science the following semester.

                <strong>Finding Direction</strong><br>
                Left university to reassess my path. Worked delivering pizzas and at a coffee shop, where I met my future wife.
                During this time, I developed a strong interest in economics as I speedran my libertarian phase. I read Atlas Shrugged, then Milton Friedman, but could never get into Von Mises and Rothbard.
                I was a big fan of Alex Tabbarok and Tyler Cowen's <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com">Marginal Revolution</a> blog, and it was around this time I decided that if I went back to school, it'd be to study Econ.

                This was my first real data job, which I'm convinced I landed with the phrase, "I like to tell stories with data."
                I'd been strongly influenced by a professor, Rossen Trendafilov, who introduced me to the tools used for large datasets, specifically R.
                Until then, the problems around analyzing years-worth of second-to-second data had never occurred to me. High frequency trading, for all the

        <h2>Personal Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            The world is a creation of a loving, holy, just, infinite, and infallible God.
            Humankind, having sinned once for all in Adam, requires redemption.
            This was accomplished, once for all, in the death and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth, the Christ, Son of God and one with the Father.
            The chief end of man is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever.
        </p>
        <p>
            Econ is a pretty useful tool for understanding the above. Psychology is another.
            Education in the physical sciences, and a life lived in practical application thereof, is of some value as well.
            However, its value is tempered by a set of affinities a given person may have, which may be natural or societal in origin.
            Which is to say, it's useful to know why the planets move around the sun, why the sky is blue, and what happens when water boils.
            This is another thing entirely than knowing innately how to apply these facts, or what lessons may be drawn from experiments with them (deductive and inductive reasoning, respectively)
