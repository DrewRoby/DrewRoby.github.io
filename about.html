            Welcome to my personal page! I've traveled a winding road to get where I am today, from nuclear submarines to economics,
            from agriculture to technology. Here's the story of how a Navy nuclear operator eventually found his way to the world of business solutions.

                <strong>Educational Beginnings</strong><br>
                Graduated from Westminster Christian Academy in St. Louis, MO. Not yet knowing what career path to pursue,
                I made a bold decision that would shape the years to come.

                Joined the United States Navy as a nuclear operator. Completed intensive training at Naval Nuclear Power Training Command (NNPTC)
                in Goose Creek, SC, learning mechanics and nuclear power plant operations. After prototype training in Ballston Spa, NY,
                I was assigned to the USS Houston (SSN-713), homeported in Guam, where I served for 4 years.

                Left university to reassess my path. Worked delivering pizzas and at a coffee shop, where I met my future wife.
                During this time, I developed a strong interest in economics through reading libertarian economists,
                appreciating their scientific approach to understanding how the world works.

        <h2>Personal Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            My varied background has given me a unique perspective on problem-solving and business challenges.
            From the disciplined environment of nuclear submarines to the analytical world of economics,
            I've learned to approach problems methodically while keeping an eye on the bigger picture.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe that economics offers valuable insights into how the world works, and I apply these
            principles in both my professional and personal life. My journey may not have been linear,
            but each experience has contributed to who I am today.
