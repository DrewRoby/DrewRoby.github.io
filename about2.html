            Some things, if you speak them into the world, will never come true. Some will never come true if you DON'T speak them.
            It is important to know the difference.

                Like the dog who caught the car, I don't know what to do with a girlfriend. I don't have money or time to "date," and don't know what to make of my feelings.
                Out of cluelessness and desparation to feel something, I break up with L.S.

                She is unabashedly open about sex, and is the first person I can remember admitting in real life to wanting it, actively seeking it.
                But not from me.
                But that's fine, because I am still the dog. She can have my California roommate who takes calls from strippers at 3 am as much as she pleases, so long as he sleeps in her room.
                She breaks down laughing in class, because I'm scratching my back against the lockers, "like a big bear."

                <strong>A Night On The Bay</strong><br>
                I am hanging out in an expat bar in Subic Bay, shooting pool with Bobcat, when we are approached by two girls. They ask if they can join us. It comes up that they're just looking for fun, not for boyfriends.
                "That's fine," I say, "we're gay."
                "Oh good, we're lesbians."
                It turns out we are both lying, but I spend the night watching Bobcat get increasingly frustrated with his disinterested date, while mine snuggles closer to me.

                She is the girlfriend of a friend, and touches naked people for a living.
                She sits on my lap at a party, stares into my eyes, and says "You know, your lips are very... kissable."
                I remain oblivious. A conversation we have many weeks later makes her cry, a lot, and we never speak again.

                <strong>Foreign Shores</strong><br>
                A middle-aged Korean woman works as a Mama San at a strip club, and takes a shine to me. She invites me to her sister's bar up on the hill, where Dong Man Lee teaches me how to shoot pool properly (get down to the table level, it's so obvious).
                She feeds me weird dried fish and other snacks. She brings a plastic bag full of K-soaps on VHS to my apartment, where she finds I do not have a television.
                I take her home later that night, and we break up before a long underway.

                I should have gone up to her apartment. I regret not.
                Beyond her, tied for regret, are my tripartite failures to start relationships with a powerlifter, a cheerleader, and another cheerleader.
                Two of the three were interested. The third was aspirational but man what a difference that would have made.
