            Some things, if you speak them into the world, will never come true. Some will never come true if you DON'T speak them.
            It is important to know the difference.

                She is beautiful and soft and willing, and like the dog who caught the car, I have no idea what to do with her. <br>
                Even if I had money and time to "date," where are all the feelings I was supposed to have? Blank is more concerning than outright bad.
                Out of cluelessness and desperation, I break up with her.  <br>
                Some months later I proceed to ask her to the senior prom, and thereby discover the iron law of "one chance, per girl, per lifetime."

                She is unabashedly open about sex, and is the first female I can remember admitting in real life to wanting it, actively seeking it. <br>
                But not from me. <br>
                But that's fine, because I am still the dog. She can have my California roommate who takes calls from strippers at 3am, so long as he sleeps in her room.
                She breaks down laughing in class, because I'm scratching my back against the lockers, "like a big bear," for which I am reprimanded. <br>

                <strong>On The Waterfront</strong><br>
                I am hanging out in an expat bar in Subic Bay, shooting pool with Bobcat, when we are approached by two girls. They ask if they can join us. It comes up that they're just looking for fun, not for boyfriends. <br>
                "That's fine," I say, "we're gay." <br>
                "Oh good, we're lesbians." <br>
                It turns out we are both lying, but I spend the night watching Bobcat get increasingly frustrated with his disinterested date, while mine snuggles closer to me. <br>

                She is the girlfriend of a friend, and is quick to tell me she does in-home services.
                She sits on my lap at a party, stares into my eyes, and says "You know, your lips are very... kissable."
                I remain oblivious. <br>
                A conversation we have many weeks later makes her cry, a lot, and we never speak again.

                A middle-aged Korean woman works as a mama-san, and takes a shine to me on Suit Night with the boys. She invites me to her sister's bar up on the top of Pale San Vitores, where Dong Man Lee teaches me how to shoot pool properly (get down to the table level, it's so obvious). <br>
                She feeds me with chopsticks, weird dried fish and other snacks. She brings a plastic bag full of K-soaps on VHS to my apartment, where she finds I do not have a television. <br>
                I take her back home later that night. We break up before a long underway.

                I should have gone up to her apartment. I regret not. <br>
                Beyond her, tied for regret, are my tripartite failures to pursue relationships with a powerlifter and two cheerleaders (not at the same time, but boy howdy). <br>
                Of the three, two were interested. The third, girlfriend of a friend; errors compounding on errors.

                It takes three hours of conversation at a picnic table in the snow for her to tell me we're through. <br>
