            Welcome! You've reached the web portal and online resume of <strong>Andrew Roby</strong>.
            I hope this doesn't come across as satirical or ironic; rather
            as an earnestly goofy love letter to the design of a different time.<br>

        <h1>Excerpts from "Andrew Roby: Ready To Work"</h1>
        <p>
            Here's what I do when I sit down to work, I straighten out three things:
            <li>Physical Comfort</li>
            <li>Aesthetics</li>
            <li>Work</li>
            <br>in that order.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Physical comfort</strong> <br>
            You have to feel ok first, you know? You gotta be alert and pain-free, as much as you can.
            So stretch, do a minute of horse stance and deep breathing, pop a tylenol, get a drink of water, take a leak.<br>
            Whatever you need to do to feel ok sitting down or standing in place for a while, do that.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Aesthetics</strong> <br>
            Don't do work in an ugly space, but remember that ugly is relative. <br>
            Wherever you are, do something to elevate that space: open a window, light a candle, set a fan going; if it's too quiet, put on some music.
            If you're in a public place with lots of noise, put in some earplugs.
            Move into the sunshine or the shade, as appropriate. Silence your phone.<br>
            Whatever it is, find one thing to make the space better for yourself and anyone who might join you to work, and do that.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Work</strong> <br>
            It might seem needlessly recursive to put "Work" as an item in this list, but when you set down to work, you must overcome a great deal of intertia.
            The preceding few minutes should have set you rolling, mentally and physically. By now you should have some elevated level of feel-good hormones circulating.
            Follow through on that momentum, build on it.  Set into your tasks with the intent to accomplish them.<br>
            Whatever you need to do to make something good today, do that.
        </p>
