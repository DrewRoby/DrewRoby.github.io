            You've reached the web portal and online resume of Andrew Roby!
            <strong>Prospective employers</strong>, please note that this is mostly not satire;
            rather it's another of those love letters to the design of a different time.

        <h1>Excerpts from "Andrew Roby: Ready To Work"</h1>
        <p>
            Here's what I do when I sit down to work, I straighten out three things:
            <li>Physical Comfort</li>
            <li>Aesthetics</li>
            <li>Work</li>
            <br>in that order.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Physical comfort</strong> <br>
            You have to feel ok first, you know? You gotta be alert and pain-free, as much as you can.
            So stretch, do a minute of horse stance and deep breathing, pop a tylenol, get a drink of water, take a leak.<br>
            Whatever it is you need to do to feel ok sitting down for a while, do that.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Aesthetics</strong> <br>
            Don't do work in an ugly space, but remember that ugly is relative. <br>
            Wherever you are, do something to elevate that space: open a window, light a candle, set a fan going; if it's too quiet, put on some music.
            If you're in a public place with lots of noise, put in some earplugs.
            Move into the sunshine or the shade, as appropriate. Silence your phone.<br>
            Whatever it is you need to do to make the space better for yourself and anyone who might join you to work, do that.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Work</strong> <br>
            It might seem needlessly recursive to put "Work" as an item in this list, but when you set down to work, you must overcome a great deal of intertia.
            The preceding few minutes should have set you rolling, mentally and physically. By now you should have some elevated level of feel-good hormones circulating.
            Follow through on that momentum, build it. To do this, you must know what work you intend to get done. Understand and write down what goals are achievable for the day, and which from yesterday are unmet.
            Then set into them with the intent to accomplish them.<br>
            Whatever it is you need to do to make something good today, do that.
